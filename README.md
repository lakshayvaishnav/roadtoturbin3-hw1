# Solana Wallet and Enrollment Project

This project consists of several TypeScript files that interact with the Solana blockchain. The primary functionalities include generating a keypair for a wallet, airdropping SOL tokens on the Devnet, transferring tokens using the system program, and enrolling in a course by interacting with a deployed contract.

## Project Files

### 1. `keygen.ts`
- **Purpose**: Generates a new keypair that acts as your wallet on the Solana blockchain.
- **Functionality**: This file utilizes the `@solana/web3.js` library to create a keypair, which is essential for performing transactions on the network.

### 2. `airdrop.ts`
- **Purpose**: Airdrops SOL tokens to your wallet on the Solana Devnet.
- **Functionality**: This script connects to the Solana Devnet and requests an airdrop of SOL tokens to the wallet generated by `keygen.ts`. It ensures you have funds available for further transactions.

### 3. `transfer.ts`
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates the transfer functionality using the Solana system program.
- **Functionality**: This file allows you to transfer SOL tokens from your wallet to another address. It leverages the capabilities of the Solana system program to facilitate secure and efficient transfers.

### 4. `enroll.ts`
- **Purpose**: Enrolls your username in a course by interacting with an already deployed contract called "webprereq".
- **Functionality**: This script implements Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) and uses concepts such as bump seeds and IDL (Interface Definition Language) to add your username onto the blockchain. This is part of the enrollment process in the course.

## Getting Started

To run these scripts, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository**:
```
git clone https://github.com/lakshayvaishnav/roadtoturbin3-hw1
```
2. **Install dependencies**:
```
yarn install
```

3. **Run the scripts**:
You can execute each script using Yarn. Replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you want to run:

For example:
- To generate a keypair:
  ```
  yarn keygen
  ```
- To airdrop SOL:
  ```
  yarn airdrop
  ```
- To transfer SOL:
  ```
  yarn transfer
  ```
- To enroll in a course:
  ```
  yarn enroll
  ```

## Conclusion

This project serves as an educational tool for understanding key functionalities of the Solana blockchain, including wallet management, token transfers, and interacting with smart contracts using PDAs.
